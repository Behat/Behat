Feature: Use multiline titles
  In order to keep all information
  As a features developer
  I want that the full text of multiline titles is kept in JUnit reports

  Scenario: Adding some interesting
  value
    Then I must have 10
    And I add 6
    Then I must have 16

  another
  value
    Then I must have 10

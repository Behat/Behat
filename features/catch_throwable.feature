Feature: Support PHP 7 Throwable
  In order for my test suite to continue running despite fatal errors in my code
  As a feature developer
  I need Behat to gracefully handle errors implementing the Throwable interface

  Background:
    Given a file named "features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php" with:
      """
      <?php

      use Behat\Behat\Context\Context,
          Behat\Behat\Exception\PendingException;

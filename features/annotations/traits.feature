      Feature: Apples story
        In order to eat apple
        As a little kid
        I need to have an apple in my pocket

        Background:
          Given I have 3 apples

        Scenario: I'm little hungry
          When I ate 1 apple
          Then I should have 2 apples

        Scenario: Found more apples
          When I found 5 apples
          Then I should have 8 apples

        Scenario: Found more apples
          When I found 2 apples
          Then I should have 5 apples

        Scenario Outline: Other situations
          When I ate <ate> apples
          And I found <found> apples
          Then I should have <result> apples

          Examples:
            | ate | found | result |
            | 3   | 1     | 1      |
            | 0   | 4     | 7      |

  Scenario: Run feature with failing scenarios
    When I run "behat -f progress"
    Then it should pass with:

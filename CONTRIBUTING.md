Contributing
------------

Behat is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- __Always__ as base for your changes use `develop` branch (all new development happens here, `master` branch is for releases & hotfixes only),
- Add `*.features` for those changes (please look into `features/` folder for some examples). This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally,
- Commit your code, but do not mess with `BehatApplication` version, or `CHANGES.md` one,
- __Remember__: when you create Pull Request, always select `develop` branch as target, otherwise it will be closed.

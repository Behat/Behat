Contributing
------------

Behat is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- __Always__ as base for your changes use `master` branch (all new development
  happens here),
- Add `*.features` for those changes (please look into `features/` folder for
  some examples). This is important so we don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally,
- Commit your code, but do not mess with `BehatApplication` version, or
  `CHANGES.md` one,
- __Remember__: when you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as
  target, otherwise it will be closed (this is selected by default).

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Starting from `v3.0.0`, Behat is following [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This means that we take backwards compatibility of public API very seriously. So unless you want your PR to start a
new major version of Behat (`v4.0.0` for example), you need to make sure that either you do not change existing
interfaces and their usage across the system or that you at least introduce backwards compatibility layer together with
your change. Not following these rules will cause a rejection of your PR. Exception could be an extremely rare case
where BC break is introduced as a measure to fix a serious issue.

You can read detailed guidance on what BC means in [Symfony2 BC guide](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).

Third-party dependencies & versioning
-------------------------------------

Starting from `v3.2.0` we also promise to not break the minimum required dependencies version (like Symfony) in the
patch updates. However, we sometimes will need to break the minimum required versions for minor updates, but only in
case where current version in question became unsupported or obsolete.

Contributing to Formatter Translations
--------------------------------------

Almost any output message (except exceptions and custom output) printed by Behat
formatters could be translated into your language with `--lang` option. In order
to fix/add translation, edit the appropriate section of the `i18n.php` file.

Running tests
-------------

Make sure that you don't break anything with your changes by running the test
suite with your locale set to english:

```bash
$> LANG=C bin/behat
```

Contributing
------------

Before contributing to Behat, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

Versioning
----------

Starting from `v3.0.0`, Behat is following [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This basically means that if all you do is implement interfaces (like [this one](https://github.com/Behat/Behat/blob/v3.1.0/src/Behat/Behat/Context/ContextClass/ClassResolver.php#L15-L22))
and use service constants (like [this one](https://github.com/Behat/Behat/blob/v3.1.0/src/Behat/Behat/Context/ServiceContainer/ContextExtension.php#L46)),
you would not have any backwards compatibility issues with Behat up until `v4.0.0` (or later major)
is released. Exception could be an extremely rare case where BC break is introduced as a measure
to fix a serious issue.

You can read detailed guidance on what BC means in [Symfony BC guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).
